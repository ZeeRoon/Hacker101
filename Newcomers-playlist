1. Introduction
Instructor: Cody Brocious
We will learn:
- How to identify, exploite and remediate top web security vulns and bugs
- how to handle cryptography
- how to review and design apps via a security standpoint
- how to operate as a bug bounty hunter or a security consultant and much more

requirements:
- OS can run java apps
- learn automation of requests, (like python request library)

Must have tools:
- Burp Proxy (Free or Pro -> recommended when working as a pro), for intercepting web requests and inspection
- Firefox, for setting proxy only via the browser and other cool stuff

Breaker Mindset:
Thing like a breaker, break things before anyone else can, so that it can be fixed.
For that, think like an attacker, their goals, aim, methods etc.

the most trivial way to see what a button do is to push it, similarly, in an app every button or key or function 
does something, to understand that we have to try it to better understand an app.

The imbalance between attacker and defender - is that attacker just has to find one bug or two or chain of them to break the system but
a defender must find all of them, so the attacker has more advantage. but we will never find every bug as we venture and fix bugs we create
new ones.

we should be able to understand the goal of an attacker, lets say, hacker breached into a E-commerce site, s/he will most likely go for credit
card numbers and transactions and for other systems, the goal is different, so thinking that side may open up creative ways to find and exploit
bugs and patch them.

now that, the goal is understood, prioritize the task, think what keeps the devs up late at night, which key areas they are more concern with. 
talk to them, ask them. and prioritize areas or bugs, does bug A can affect others or does bug B does that or both, like that. does bug A has higher
risk or bug B.

Reporting:
For the course or most likely for starters, include-
* Title
* Severity
* Description
* Reproduction Steps
* Impact
* Mitigation
* Affected Assests

severity is subjective, many organization think differently of it.
The instructor use these -
* Informational - issue has no real impact but it could in the future
* Low - the business impact has minimal
* Medium - has potential to cause harm to users or business but not revealing any data
* High - has potential to cause harm and reveal data and aids in exploitation of other vulns
* Critical - High risk of personel and confidential data exposure, system compromise and harm to the business

First Bug-
overview of rXXS or reflected cross site scripting

Next session - how web works, indepth understanding and XXS forgery. setup proxy and look for flow of data when you browse several sites.
